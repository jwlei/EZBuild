EZBuild is a stripped down continuation with the features I used the most from Enta's MuchBetterHotkeys since I found that the pipette tool had stopped working as intended after H&H.

# Now updated for Mistlands (finally..)

If you find any bugs please report it here: https://github.com/jwlei/EZBuild/issues
 

## Features:

Interact with objects while a tool is equipped. (Hammer, Hoe etc.)

Configuration manager integration

Keybindable pipette tool for quickly selecting pieces you are already using or while looking at a 
resource (e.g. a copper vein, press the hotkey and the highest tier, highest durability pickaxe or 
axe will be equipped. (Default: Q)

Prefer 1H or 2H Axe when pipetting a wood-resource

Hotkey for Hammer (Default: B)

Hotkey for repair while Hammer is equipped (Default: V)



## Installation:
Use mod manager or manually put EZBuild.dll inside Valheim/BepInEx/plugins

## Configuration:
Use either the Configuration manager integration (F1) or manually edit the keybinds in the EZBuild.cfg file.

If you don't want to use the feature, leave the hotkey field blank.

## Conflicts:
If you have auto-run on Q it will be triggered while trying to pipette with the axe or pickaxe.
